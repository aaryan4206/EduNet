# EduNet

Edunet is flask based teacher-student connect portal. Its primary featurs are sending and receiving messages and pdfs but in different sections making it extremely easy to use. 

In EduNet teachers have the access to send messages and pdfs while students can only view messages and pdfs.

Several major updates will be coming soon.
